A classmate and I developed the backend for an application built for the ITMarathon Hackathon 2024 in Ia»ôi. Our task was to create a digital assets trading platform where users could track prices, view the assets they own, and buy or sell assets.

We used the ASP.NET framework along with Dapper for data mapping.
